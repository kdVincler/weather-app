import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* Any component call has to be in this div!!!! VERY IMPORTANT */}
      <h1>This is a skeleton file that was created by create-react-app and modified</h1>
      <p>
        I got rid of the placeholder text in App.js and the styling in App.css
        <br />
        !BUT!
        <br />
        if you want your actual react components to run here, then import them and call them in the div that this h1 and paragraph is. (I left a comment in the code too)
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
